# Open-Exploitation-2
 For those who want to get an idea of what EXP-401 is about. This is NOT an official course.

# Disclaimer
 I will not upload any files to this repository until I have confirmed permission to create this. While this repository will be based on the [EXP-401 course syllabus](https://www.offensive-security.com/awe/EXP401_syllabus.pdf), this will closely represent the course and its teachings, without ever using any of Offensive Security's course material.

 This repository, by design, is to provide those who are interested in the EXP-401 course offered by Offensive Security, and to provide those who are taking the course with some alternative exercises to strengthen their knowledge.

 Lastly, this repository will update **only** if the original course material is updated **and** I have been granted permission to update this repository. If new exploit development methodologies and concepts are introduced into the course, I will update this repository accordingly as necessary. The material provided in this repository may be incomplete or inaccurate. Please create issues accordingly if you notice any problems.
